# Trace_File_Generator
<strong>Generate Trace File with format : W [TAB] LSN</strong>
<br></br>

<strong>< Build Option ></strong>
<br>
- Modify this predefined macro as you want
- When generating trace file, it can be except for the capacity allocated to the Spare Block (according to SPARAE_BLOCK_RATIO).

| Predefined Macro | For What |
|:---:|:---:|
| RAND_MODE | Generate trace file with random sequence (0 : Not Use, 1 : Use) |
| OVERWRITE_COUNT | Create the same write operation as the current OVERWRITE_COUNT macro for each LSN (Default : 0) |
| SPARE_BLOCK_RATIO | The rate of spare blocks to be managed by the system for the total number of blocks (Blocks that cannot be record data directly) (Default : 0.08, 8%) |
<br>

<strong>< Functions List ></strong>
<br>
| Index | Functions |
|:---:|:---|
| (0) | Create by the total number of sectors (pages) corresponding to the units of megabytes |
| (1) | Create a user-specified number of sectors (pages) |
| (2) | Create by the "total number of sectors (pages) corresponding to the units of megabyte - total number of sectors (pages) of the Spare Block" |
| (3) | Following Function (2), enter the percentage and multiply the total number of sectors (pages) to be generated by the percentage. |
